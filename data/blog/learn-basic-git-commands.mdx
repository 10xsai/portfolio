**There are many things you can do with React Refs. Refs in React are a powerful tool but they can be tricky and can be misused easily which can lead to lots of bugs and unexpected behaviours. we will go through most of the ways we can utilize the Refs for good**

You can read more about `git commands` in [git-scm docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git).

## Git clone
### Clone repository

```
Using this command you can download and initialize a repository from a remote url into your local machine.

### Clone repository with different name
```bash
git clone { repository_url } { folder_name }
```

### Clone to a specific directory
```bash
git clone { repository_url } { directory_path }
```

### Clone a specific branch
```bash
git clone -b { branch_name } { repository_url }
```

## Intializing a repository from folder
### Using git init
```bash
git init
```
To initialize a repository, Git creates a hidden directory called .git . This .git directory stores all of the objects and refs that Git uses and creates as a part of your project's history.

### Connect initialized repository to remote url
```bash
git remote add origin { repository_url }
```

## Commiting changes to repository
### To Check status of files
```bash
git status
```
<span style={{color:'green'}}>Green lines</span> indicate files are added to staging area.

<span style={{color:'red'}}>Red lines</span> indicate files are not added to staging area.

### Add files to staging area
```bash
# Add particular file to staging area
git add ${ file1.txt } ${ file2.txt }

# To add all files in that directory
git add .
```

### Commit changes
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### Push code
```bash
# Push to master branch
git push origin master

# Push to a particular branch
git push origin { branch_name }

# Push all branches to remote repository
git push --all origin
```
---
## Pulling code from a branch
```bash
# Pull from master branch
git pull origin master

# Push to a particular branch
git pull origin { branch_name }
```

## Commands on Git Branch
### List all branches

```

### Creates a new branch and switches to newly created branch
```bash
git checkout -b { branch_name }
